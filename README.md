# task-client
An Ionic/React to do app that connects to its sibling project, [task-api](https://github.com/Devocalpyse/task-api).

## Intro

Hello! This is an Ionic app, built with React TypeScript and Capacitor, that creates a standard but functional task list app, or to-do app, whichever is your preference. This repository includes only the essential code, and none of the node.js modules needed, nor the build files needed to create a native app in Android or iOS (usually named `dist`).

## How Do I use this?

Simple! Just clone both repositories to your local computer, install the necessary dependencies, and change the URLs of the connections to whatever works (usually, it is `localhost:8100` for Ionic and `localhost:3000` for the API, but it can differ depending on your case).
